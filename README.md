# mvnu_cs_utility
This is a simple wrapper library for use in CS1/2 courses at MVNU. There are Netbeans 8 (Ant, under the Ant folder) and Netbeans 12 (Maven, under MVNU_CS_Utility_Library folder)  
based builds. For courses with a Spring 2020 start date, the Maven based build is needed without restoring to complex JavaFx installs.
